Boost charge voltage = absorption voltage
Boost duration = absorption time

Over volts disconnect : if the battery volts exceed this , the load outputs disconnect from the load from the battery.

Charging limit voltage: if the battery volts exceed this, charging the battery from solar is stopped.

Over Voltage reconnect: if the load outputs have been disconnected due to the battery exceeding over voltage a reconnect will occur at this value.

Equalize charge voltage: used for lead acid batteries where a higher voltage is applied every 28 days for a duration to equalise the cells. Normally only used with flooded batteries. Use with sealed, AGM and GEL lead batteries only with manufactures approval.

Boost charge voltage: under the boost mode, the controller will charge the battery at maximum power from the solar panels until this value is reached. At all times before this 'target' voltage is reached the maximum power control process will will try to 'pull' maximum power from the panels. This is the bulk stage of charging where most of the battery capacity is restored.

Float charge voltage: once the boost duration has been completed the controller will modify the maximum power search and load the panels to produce a constant float voltage at the battery. Typically used for lead acid batteries to compensate for the self discharge. With lead acid batteries it may also 'top up' the battery. Where lithium batteries are charged setting to the resting voltage of the battery may be used.

Boost reconnect voltage: once the unit is in float mode the voltage may vary due to solar conditions and any load on the battery. If the battery voltage falls to this value the controller re enters the Boost stage.

Low voltage reconnect: if the load outputs have been disconnected due to a low battery, this voltage is the turn on value.

Under voltage warning re connect: warning turned off at this voltage.

Under voltage warning: warning set at this voltage.

Low voltage disconnect: load outputs are disconnected from the battery at this voltage.

Discharging limit voltage: other than issuing a warning at the set voltage the stand alone unit cannot do anything about this.

Equalize Duration: the time duration where the voltage is held constant with equalisation for lead acid batteries

Boost Duration: once the boost voltage has been reached the voltage will be held constant for this period. This is the absorption period where the battery is completely charged.
